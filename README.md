MSDS 460 Final Project

# Repo Organization
The first iteration of the simulation is in MSDS460Final.py. The code used to get results is in Simulation.py. The results for the different runs are in the results folder. There are two types of distributions of service times and 5 runs for each. The inter arrival time is an exponential distribution. Inside each run folder there are figures, output.txt with the terminal output and initial setup for the simulation. The log files are also in each run. 

# Different Runs
run 1: 6 sp, 1 manager

run 2: 6 sp, 2 manager

run 3: 3 sp, 1 manager

run 4: 10 sp, 1 manager

run 5: 
- max service time for both queue_1 and queue_2 increased by 5 min (uniform distribution)
- mean service time for both queue_1 and queue_2 increased by 5 min (normal distribution)
